https://chrispalmeri.github.io/lch-color-palette/

## to do

  * you probably don't need to generate every possible color with clipping data

# local sever

```bash
python -V
# Or you might have the py command available,
# in which case try py -V

# If Python version returned above is 3.X
python3 -m http.server
# On windows try "python" instead of "python3", or "py -3"

# If Python version returned above is 2.X
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
