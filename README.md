  * IE 11 does not like arrow functions or css grid

## to do

  * vertical slider would be nice too
     * or just space the top and bottom even instead of 1/2
  * actually showing the offset moving on the screen would be nice
     * non-issue now that circles are hidden

Also made the swatches as big as possible

# local sever

```bash
python -V
# Or you might have the py command available,
# in which case try py -V
# If Python version returned above is 3.X
python3 -m http.server
# On windows try "python" instead of "python3", or "py -3"
# If Python version returned above is 2.X
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
